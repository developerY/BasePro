Using an NFC ViewModel in your MainActivity doesn't inherently break Modern Android Development (MAD) 
architecture rules—as long as you follow the principles of separation of concerns and dependency injection.

### Key Points:
- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  The NFC logic (processing the tag, updating UI state) is still encapsulated in the ViewModel and repository. 
- The MainActivity merely acts as a bridge to forward NFC intents (which are an Activity-level concern) to the ViewModel. 
- This is acceptable because NFC intents must be received at the Activity level.

- **Lifecycle and DI:**  
  With Hilt or your preferred DI framework, the NFC ViewModel is properly scoped to the Activity (or navigation route) 
- and managed according to lifecycle rules. This ensures that the ViewModel remains decoupled from UI code.

- **UI-Driven Design:**  
  The ViewModel drives the UI state, and your Compose UI observes that state. Even if the MainActivity 
- handles the NFC intent, it immediately passes that event to the ViewModel, which then updates the UI accordingly.

### Conclusion:
No, having the NFC ViewModel in your MainActivity does not break MAD architecture rules—as long as the 
Activity's role is limited to receiving the NFC intent and forwarding it to the NFC module’s ViewModel. 
This pattern keeps your NFC feature modular and leverages the strengths of the MVVM architecture.
