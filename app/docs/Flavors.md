🔥 Love the vision — **daily delivery for every app** is a bold and beautiful move. Let’s break it
down clearly so you can pick the **best delivery pipeline**.

---

## 🎯 Goal: Ship `bike`, `home`, `medtime`, and `photodo` to the Play Store **daily
**, as separate apps with their own icons, app names, and behavior.

That means:

- 🛠 4 separate APKs (or AABs) built **automatically**
- 💎 Each with its **own branding, versioning, and entry point**
- 🚀 Delivered reliably, e.g., via GitHub Actions, Bitrise, or CI/CD

---

## ✅ Best Option: **Product Flavors + CI/CD**

### 🎛 Product Flavors

Define one **flavor per app**:

```kotlin
android {
    flavorDimensions += "app"
    productFlavors {
        create("bike") {
            dimension = "app"
            applicationId = "com.ylabz.bike"
            versionName = "1.0-bike"
            resValue("string", "app_name", "Bike App")
        }
        create("home") {
            dimension = "app"
            applicationId = "com.ylabz.home"
            versionName = "1.0-home"
            resValue("string", "app_name", "Home App")
        }
        // repeat for others
    }
}
```

Then configure:

- `RootNavGraph()` to route based on flavor
- Launcher icon via `mipmap-[flavor]/ic_launcher.png`
- Optional: different themes or features per app

**Per-flavor files**:

```
app/
 └── src/
     ├── bike/
     │   ├── AndroidManifest.xml
     │   ├── res/values/strings.xml (app_name)
     │   └── res/mipmap/ic_launcher_foreground.png
     ├── home/
     └── ...
```

---

### 🤖 CI/CD: GitHub Actions or Bitrise

Run this daily:

```bash
./gradlew clean assembleBikeRelease
./gradlew clean assembleHomeRelease
./gradlew clean assembleMedtimeRelease
./gradlew clean assemblePhotodoRelease
```

Or use `bundle*` if you want AABs:

```bash
./gradlew bundleBikeRelease
```

CI will:

- Pull the latest code
- Build each flavor
- Upload to Play Console via `fastlane` or Play Developer API

### ✅ Why Flavors Are Better for Daily Multi-App Shipping

| Manual Build                                      | Product Flavors                      |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Change `RootNavGraph`, icon, dependencies by hand | All config handled by Gradle flavors |
| Only one app can be built per commit              | All apps can be built in parallel    |
| Not CI-friendly                                   | CI-native, very scriptable           |
| App switching is manual                           | Just run `assembleBikeRelease` etc.  |
| Fragile / risky                                   | Clean, automated separation          |

## 🧠 Conclusion: Go Flavors + CI/CD

You’re already structured for it — your `applications/*` are isolated and modular. Just add flavors,
point to the right `applicationId`, launcher, and nav graph per flavor, and let CI do the heavy
lifting.

Would you like:

- 🚀 A sample `build.gradle.kts` with the flavor blocks already set up?
- 🛠️ A GitHub Actions script for daily shipping?
- 🎨 Launcher icon switching per flavor?

Let’s build it out together.
