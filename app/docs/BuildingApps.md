## âœ… How to Build the `.aab` for the Bike App

You're already using **flavors**, so here's how to build the correct bundle:

### ðŸŸ¢ Step-by-Step in Android Studio

1. **In the Build Variants panel**  
   Set `:app` to:
   ```
   bikeRelease
   ```

2. **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build Bundle**

3. âœ… When it finishes, look at the bottom for:
   ```
   app/build/outputs/bundle/bikeRelease/app-bike-release.aab
   ```

Thatâ€™s your **Play Store-ready upload**.

### âœ… Pro Tips for Release AAB

#### 1. **Signing Config**

If you haven't already, youâ€™ll need to set up a `signingConfig` for release builds:

```kotlin
buildTypes {
   release {
      isMinifyEnabled = providers.gradleProperty("isMinifyForRelease").get().toBoolean()
      proguardFiles(
         getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android-optimize.txt"),
         "proguard-rules.pro"
      )
   }
   // This debug block ensures a fast development cycle
   debug {
      isMinifyEnabled = false
   }
}
```

Set up a `release` signing config using:

- Android Studio's **Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK**
- Or by manually adding a keystore in `gradle.properties` + `build.gradle.kts`

#### 2. **versionCode / versionName**

Each time you upload to the Play Store, **`versionCode` must increase**.  
Update it in your `defaultConfig` or dynamically via CI.

Making Build with APK for Android Studio - NOT FOR PLAY STORE!
---

## âœ… To Build the `bike` App in Android Studio:

### ðŸŸ¢ Step 1: Confirm You Selected the `bike` Flavor

âœ… In your screenshot, under `Build Variants`, you have:

```
:app â†’ bikeDebug (default)
```

That's perfect. You're telling Android Studio:
> "Use the `bike` flavor, and build the debug variant."

---

### ðŸš€ Step 2: Build the APK

Now do one of the following:

#### Option 1: From the Menu

1. Click **Build** > **Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** > **Build APK(s)**
2. Wait for the build to finish
3. Click the link in the bottom right ("locate") to find the `.apk` file

**OR**

#### Option 2: Right-Click the `app` Module

1. Right-click the `app` module in the project tree
2. Choose **"Build Module 'app'"**

---

### ðŸ§ª Want the Release APK?

If you're ready for a **Play Store build** (Proguard off by default):

1. Go to **Build Variants** (bottom-left pane)
2. Change `:app` to `bikeRelease`
3. Then use the same menu:
   > **Build** > **Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** > **Build APK(s)**

Your signed `bikeRelease.apk` will be in:

```
app/build/outputs/apk/bike/release/app-bike-release.apk
```

---

### âœ… Bonus: AAB for Play Store?

Instead of an APK:
> **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build Bundle**

Output:

```
app/build/outputs/bundle/bikeRelease/app-bike.aab
```

Let me know if you want to **generate separate icons or splash screens** for each flavor â€” or
automate the whole thing via script or GitHub Actions ðŸ˜Ž
