Absolutely! That’s one of the core benefits of having a shared repository layer and a unidirectional
data flow. As long as your repo and ViewModel(s) remain platform-agnostic (i.e., they don’t depend
on platform-specific APIs), both the phone and watch can use the exact same logic:

1. **Repository** acts as the single “source of truth,” encapsulating how data is fetched and
   updated.
2. **ViewModels** (phone vs. watch) each manage their own UI state and handle UI events, but they
   both delegate to the same **repo** for data operations.
3. **EventsUI sealed class** + **StateUI** let you keep everything consistent across platforms.
   Composables on phone or watch dispatch the same actions (events) into their ViewModels, which
   forward them to the repository.

Because the repository logic is shared and stateless in terms of “which device is calling,” it
doesn’t
really matter which ViewModel you’re using—it all just works, as you said. This approach nicely
avoids
duplication and ensures the phone and Wear OS remain in sync in terms of feature functionality.

## Android XR

You can absolutely apply the same high-level, multi-layer (MAD) architecture for Android XR.
As with phone and Wear OS, the underlying idea remains:

Keep data and business logic in a shared module (repository, models, use-cases) so it’s UI- or
platform-agnostic.
Have separate UI layers for each platform (phone, wearOS, XR) that connect to the shared logic.
Use a unidirectional data flow (e.g., ViewModel → UI state → UI events → back to ViewModel/repo).
