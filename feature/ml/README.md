# Feature: Machine Learning (ML)

## Overview

The `feature:ml` module is a placeholder and foundational module intended to house all on-device machine learning capabilities for the `BasePro` project. Its purpose is to provide a dedicated space for integrating ML models and their associated processing logic.

While the current implementation is a basic scaffold, it establishes the architectural pattern for adding future ML-powered features, such as activity recognition, route prediction, or image analysis.

## Key Components

-   **`MLComposeApp.kt`**: The primary Jetpack Compose entry point for this feature. It currently serves as a simple container for the ML feature's UI.
-   **`MLAppScreen.kt`**: The main screen of the module. In its current state, it is a placeholder screen that can be expanded to include UI elements for interacting with ML models.

## Core Functionality (Future Vision)

This module is designed to support functionalities such as:

-   **Model Loading:** Loading pre-trained TensorFlow Lite (`.tflite`) or other on-device models.
-   **Input Preprocessing:** Preparing input data (e.g., sensor readings, images) into the format required by the ML model.
-   **Inference:** Running the ML model to get predictions.
-   **Output Post-processing:** Interpreting the model's output and translating it into meaningful information for the user or other parts of the application.

## Dependencies

-   **Jetpack Compose**: For building the user interface.
-   **(Future) TensorFlow Lite SDK**: This would be the core dependency for running on-device models.

## Usage

As the feature is developed, an application would navigate to the `MLComposeApp` to access its functionality. For example, an app might pass sensor data to this module and receive a classification of the user's current activity (e.g., "running", "cycling").

This modular approach ensures that the complexities of machine learning are encapsulated, keeping the rest of the codebase clean and focused on its core responsibilities.
