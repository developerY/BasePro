## Deleting a Ride and All Its Health Connect Data

When you record a bike ride in Health Connect, you actually write several distinct pieces of data:

* **One ExerciseSessionRecord** describing the overall session (start/end times, type, title, etc.).
* **Zero or more raw/aggregate records** (steps, distance, calories, heart-rate, etc.) that capture
  the detailed metrics for that same time window.

Because these are stored as separate records, deleting a ride means removing **all** of them.
Here’s how we explain the process to users and fellow developers:

---

### 1. Why multiple records exist

* **Session vs. metrics**
  Health Connect models a “session” as a logical container, plus separate metric records so that
  different apps or sensors can contribute data (for example, a heart-rate monitor or a steps
  counter).
* **Flexible aggregation**
  By storing metrics independently, any app can later ask Health Connect to **aggregate data across
  all sources** for a given session’s timeframe.

---

### 2. The need for a complete cleanup

* **No orphaned data**
  If you simply delete the session record but leave behind steps or calories records, those metric
  entries become “orphans”—data points with no visible session context.
* **User expectations**
  When a user explicitly deletes a ride from your app, they expect **all** data for that ride to
  disappear,
  leaving Health Connect free of any residual entries from your app.

---

### 3. Conceptual deletion workflow

1. **Identify the session**

    * You begin with the unique ID of the `ExerciseSessionRecord` the user wants to remove.
    * That record also carries a **data origin** tag (your app’s package name), so you know exactly
      which data you wrote.
2. **Delete the session record**

    * You ask Health Connect to delete just that one session by its ID.
3. **Locate associated metrics**

    * Using the session’s **start** and **end** timestamps plus the same data origin, you read back
      all metric records (steps, distance, calories, heart-rate, etc.) that fall inside the session
      window and were authored by your app.
4. **Delete all metric records**

    * Finally, you delete each of those metric records by their server-generated IDs.

After these steps, Health Connect contains none of the session’s data—no trace of your app’s ride is
left behind.

---

### 4. Benefits of this approach

* **Atomic “cascade” delete**
  Deleting a ride truly removes every piece of it in one coordinated operation.
* **Data isolation**
  By filtering on your app’s data origin, you only delete what your app wrote—other apps’ sessions
  and metrics remain intact.
* **User confidence**
  Knowing that deleting a ride in your app also clears its entire footprint reassures users about
  their privacy and control over data.

---

### 5. Real-world analogy

Think of Health Connect like a filing cabinet:

* Each **session** is a folder.
* The **metric records** (steps, distance, calories, heart-rate) are individual documents inside
  that folder.

Deleting a ride is like removing the entire folder and all its contents—no loose papers left on the
shelf.

---

By following this clear, step-by-step deletion process, you ensure your app leaves **no droppings**
behind in Health Connect while still allowing users (or other apps) to continue leveraging the
shared health data vault for their long-term needs.

---

Health Connect’s model intentionally treats “sessions” (the conceptual activity blocks) and
“metrics”
(steps, distance, calories, heart-rate, etc.) as separate, first-class record types. There isn’t a
single
“delete session plus everything underneath” API, because:

1. **Metrics aren’t owned exclusively by sessions.**

    * A heart-rate monitor or step counter might write data continuously, not just during a
      “session.”
      Those same samples could legitimately be used for multiple sessions or for background
      statistics.
      Automatically shredding all metrics when you delete one session could remove data other apps (
      or the user themselves) still rely on.

2. **Multiple apps can contribute data.**

    * Health Connect is a shared store. If you wrote a session and another app wrote steps or
      heart-rate in the same time window, a blind delete would wipe out the other app’s
      contributions. By forcing developers to explicitly delete only their own records (via
      time-range + data-origin filters), Health Connect prevents unintended data loss across apps.

3. **Granular control & permissions.**

    * Your app may only have write-permission for some types (e.g. sessions and calories) but not
      for others. A single “cascade delete” would require Health Connect to assume your app can
      delete metrics it never had permission to write.

4. **Flexibility in data retention.**

    * Some use-cases want to keep raw data (e.g. continuous heart-rate logging) even after a user
      “ends” or deletes a session. Health Connect lets you delete exactly what you choose, rather
      than enforcing one rigid lifecycle.

---

### So, when you delete a ride:

* **You must explicitly delete the session record** by ID.
* **Then** delete each metric type you wrote, filtered by that session’s time window and your app’s
  data origin.

That way, you—and only you—remove precisely the records your app created, without touching any other
health data in the shared repository.

---

In theory, Health Connect *could* offer a single “delete activity” call that internally deletes the
session plus all its metrics—but in practice there are several important reasons they didn’t:

1. **Metrics live independently**
   • A heart-rate sensor or step counter may be writing data continuously, not just during a named
   session. If you delete everything that falls inside the session’s time window, you risk removing
   data those other apps (or the user themselves) still depend on.
   • By keeping session records and metric records separate, Health Connect gives you precise
   control over *only* the data your app wrote.

2. **Multi-app contributions**
   • In a shared store, many apps can contribute to the same time window. A blind “cascade delete”
   could unintentionally wipe out another app’s steps or heart-rate samples that just happened to
   occur during your ride.
   • Health Connect forces you to scope your deletes by your app’s `dataOrigin`, so you only ever
   remove *your* contributions.

3. **Permission boundaries**
   • Your app might have write-permission for sessions and calories, but not for heart rate or
   distance. A one-size-fits-all delete would require Health Connect to assume you’re allowed to
   delete every metric type. Separating the calls respects the fine-grained permissions model.

4. **Flexible retention policies**
   • Some users or apps want to keep raw data (e.g. continuous heart-rate) around even if they
   delete their “run” or “ride” record. A single delete API wouldn’t let you choose “keep the raw
   sensor data but drop only the session bookmark.”

---

### What you can do instead

* **Use a consistent `clientRecordId`** on every record you write. Then you can upsert on that ID
  *and* later delete by that ID without worrying about time-range collisions.
* **Provide your own helper** (as we did above) that:

    1. Reads the session to get its time window + your `dataOrigin`.
    2. Deletes the session by ID.
    3. Deletes each metric type (steps, calories, heart-rate, etc.) filtered by that same window +
       origin.

This approach gives you exactly the “delete activity” semantics you want, while preserving Health
Connect’s guarantees around multi-app safety, data isolation, and permission boundaries.

Yes—that’s right. By default you only write Health Connect records with these bits of metadata:

* **`metadata.id`**: a server-generated UUID, unique to Health Connect.
* **`metadata.dataOrigin`**: your app’s package name, so others can tell *which app* wrote it.
* **(optionally) `metadata.clientRecordId`**: only if *you* choose to set it, e.g. to your own
  rideId.

Other apps calling `readRecords(…)` will see those metadata fields, but they have **no way** to map
back to *your* Room-database primary key. Unless you deliberately populate `clientRecordId` with
your
internal rideId, Health Connect only hands out:

1. A random Health Connect record UUID (`metadata.id`)
2. Your app’s package name as the origin

So other apps:

* **Can** tell “this record came from com.ylabz.basepro.applications.bike” via `dataOrigin`.
* **Cannot** see your internal `rideId` or any other domain-specific identifier unless you
  explicitly put it into `clientRecordId` or the record’s `notes`/`title`.

If you want *other* apps (or your own code later) to recognize and update the same session, you’d
need to set `metadata.clientRecordId = yourRideId` when inserting. But if you leave `clientRecordId`
null, Health Connect remains a clean, decoupled layer: everyone only sees the Health Connect UUID
and the package that wrote it.
