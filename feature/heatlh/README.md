### Explanation

- **core/data/service/HealthConnectManager.kt**: This manager handles the integration with Google Health APIs, making it accessible across features. Centralizing it in `core-data` allows other features to access health data if needed.
- **core/data/repository/HealthRepository.kt**: The repository abstracts data access, providing a clean API to the UI layer without exposing the underlying data sources.
- **feature/health/ui**: Only contains UI-related components for the health feature, such as `HealthUIRoute` and `HealthViewModel`.

### Benefits of This Structure

1. **Centralized Data Access**: All data-related code is located in `core-data`, making it easier to manage and reuse.
2. **Reduced Duplication**: If multiple features require access to health data, this structure ensures that they can all depend on a single `HealthConnectManager`.
3. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: UI code is isolated in feature modules, while data management logic is centralized, following Google’s guidance on a clean and modular architecture.

This structure is particularly useful for larger applications where multiple features might interact with the same data sources or APIs. It simplifies testing, enhances maintainability, and aligns closely with Google’s sample project conventions.
