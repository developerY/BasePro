### How This Differs from Regular BLE Scanning

| **Feature**                         | **Companion Device Pairing API**                           | **Regular BLE Scanning**                                |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                         | Long-term trusted pairing for companion devices          | General-purpose device discovery                      |
| **Permission Requirements**         | No fine location permission                              | Requires fine location permissions                   |
| **Built-in User Interface**         | Yes                                                      | No                                                    |
| **Device Scope**                    | Target specific device based on user action              | Discovers all nearby BLE devices                     |
| **Use Case**                        | Persistent trusted devices (e.g., fitness tracker)       | Ad hoc or dynamic connections (e.g., nearby devices) |
