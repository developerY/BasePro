### Key Improvements

- **Gradient Background:**  
  A horizontal gradient (from a warm amber to a slightly deeper orange) gives the card a modern,
  dynamic look.

- **Rounded Corners & Shadows:**  
  Increased corner rounding to 16.dp along with a more pronounced drop shadow for a softer, elevated
  feel.

- **Refined Typography:**  
  The "Temperature" label and value now use bold typography with subtle drop shadows for improved
  readability against the gradient background.

- **Simplified Sunshine Animation:**  
  The sunshine decoration has been resized and repositioned for a more elegant accent that doesn’t
  overwhelm the card’s content.

- **Thermometer Placeholder:**  
  A simple thermometer placeholder is provided so you can integrate your custom thermometer logic or
  visuals later.

This version should feel more polished and aligned with Material 3 design principles while providing
a dynamic, interactive experience for displaying the current temperature.
