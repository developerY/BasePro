# Feature: Settings

## Overview

The `feature:settings` module provides a reusable, generic settings screen for applications within
the `BasePro` ecosystem. It follows a standard UI/UX pattern for settings, allowing users to view
and modify application preferences.

This module is designed to be easily adaptable, providing a consistent look and feel for settings
across all applications while allowing each app to plug in its own specific configuration options.

## Key Components

- **`SettingsUiRoute.kt`**: The main Jetpack Compose entry point for the settings feature. It
  observes state from the `SettingsViewModel` and renders the settings UI.
- **`SettingsViewModel.kt`**: The ViewModel responsible for loading and saving settings. It
  interacts with repositories (like `AppSettingsRepository` or `UserProfileRepository` from the
  `ashbike:database` module) to persist the user's choices.
- **`SettingsUiState.kt`**: Represents the state of the settings screen, holding the current values
  of the various preferences.
- **`SettingsCompose.kt`**: The primary composable that builds the settings list, including sections
  for profile information, theme selection, and other configurable options.

## Core Functionality

- **Display Preferences:** Renders a user-friendly list of settings and their current values.
- **Modify Preferences:** Allows users to change settings, such as switching between light and dark
  themes.
- **Persist Settings:** Saves the user's changes to a persistent store (e.g., DataStore or a Room
  database) so that they are remembered across app launches.

## Dependencies

- **Jetpack Compose**: For building the entire user interface.
- **`core:data` / `ashbike:database`**: This module is highly dependent on repositories that manage
  the actual storage of settings. For example, it uses `AppSettingsRepository` to handle theme
  preferences.
- **Hilt**: For injecting the `SettingsViewModel` and its repository dependencies.

## Usage

This feature is integrated as a dedicated screen in an application's navigation graph. An
application would navigate to the `SettingsUiRoute` to allow the user to configure their
preferences. The specific settings displayed are determined by the data provided by the
`SettingsViewModel`.

```kotlin
// Example of navigating to the settings screen
navController.navigate("settings_route")
```
