How To Code Following MAD Best Practices
1. Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF)
   Event Flow: User interactions generate events that are sent to the ViewModel via the onEvent function.
   State Management: The ViewModel processes these events, performs any necessary business logic or side effects, and updates its internal state.
   State Observation: The UI layer observes the uiState exposed by the ViewModel and updates its composables accordingly.
2. Separation of Concerns
   ViewModel: Handles all business logic, state management, and side effects. It exposes immutable state flows to the UI.
   UI Layer: Composables are stateless and side-effect free. They render UI based on the observed state and send user events to the ViewModel.
3. Immutable State Exposure
   The ViewModel exposes an immutable StateFlow<HealthUiState> to the UI.
   Mutable state (MutableStateFlow) is kept private within the ViewModel.
4. Clear Event Handling
   Events are clearly defined in the HealthEvent sealed class.
   The ViewModel processes events in a centralized onEvent function, making the flow easy to trace and maintain.
5. Error Handling
   Errors are represented in the HealthUiState sealed class, allowing the UI to react appropriately to different error scenarios.

Loops:
onEvent - ViewModel
when(UiState) - ComposeRoute

**Short Answer**  
Yes, the “multi-module + shared repository + unidirectional data flow” approach described is a **very modern, highly recommended architecture** for Android—often referred to as **MAD (Modern Android Development) best practices**. It’s exactly the style that Google’s official samples and advanced community projects follow: a clean separation of concerns, modularization for reusability, testability, and scaling across different form factors (phone, Wear, XR, etc.). If you’re aiming to build a robust, large-scale Android codebase, this is definitely one of the best architectures to use.

---

## Why This Architecture Is Highly Recommended

1. **Feature-based Modules**
   - Separate modules for different features or platforms (e.g., `:feature:health`, `:wearos:health`, `:xr:health`) makes it simpler to develop, test, and maintain each feature independently.
   - You can load/unload entire features for different product flavors or devices.

2. **Layered Approach (Domain/Data/UI)**
   - A shared **data layer** (repositories, data sources) that any UI (phone, Wear, XR) can call.
   - **Domain layer** (use-cases or domain-specific logic) can also be shared if you want more explicit separation.
   - **UI layer** (ViewModels, composables) is kept platform-specific, but it’s still hooking into the same data & domain layers.

3. **Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF)**
   - You have a single source of truth in the **ViewModel** + repository.
   - The UI observes `uiState` (e.g. `StateFlow`, `LiveData`, or `MVI states`), and dispatches events back to the ViewModel.
   - This keeps your state predictable, testable, and consistent.

4. **Jetpack Compose**
   - Compose simplifies code across phone, Wear, and soon XR.
   - Compose for Wear OS uses many of the same mental models, so you can share logic and just adapt composables to smaller watch layouts.

5. **Testability**
   - Because your business logic is in a shared repository layer, you can easily write unit tests.
   - Each feature module can have its own instrumentation tests.
   - The UI is mostly thin, dealing only with state transitions.

6. **Scalability**
   - As your app grows, new features can be built in new modules, new platforms can share existing modules.
   - You avoid the “everything in one `app` module” spaghetti.

## Is This *the* Best Architecture for Everyone?

- There is **no single “silver bullet”** that’s perfect for every team and every project.
- However, the architecture we’re discussing is **squarely aligned** with Google’s recommended **MAD (Modern Android Development) approach**:
   - **MVVM or MVI** pattern.
   - **Jetpack libraries** (Compose, Hilt, Navigation, etc.).
   - **Module boundaries** that reflect features and layers.

**If your project is large or expected to scale** (especially with multi-device form factors), then this kind of modular, layered, UDF architecture is absolutely a top-tier choice. For smaller projects or prototypes, you might start simpler, but even then, following these practices can keep you from painting yourself into a corner.

---

## Examples in the Wild

- **Google’s “Now in Android” sample** demonstrates a multi-module Compose app with dynamic features.
- **Official Compose samples** show recommended patterns for state hoisting, ViewModel usage, and modularization.
- Many advanced open-source apps use a domain/data/UI separation with feature-based modules.

---

## Final Thoughts

1. **You’re on the Right Track**
   - The architecture you described—shared repos, unidirectional data flow, modular design, Compose-based UI—**is the gold standard** for 2025-era Android.

2. **Stay Flexible**
   - Don’t be afraid to tweak it to your team’s needs: you might skip a formal “domain layer” if your project is simpler, or you might add more modules (e.g., a “core:network” module) if you’re building huge enterprise apps.

3. **Keep Learning**
   - New technologies (like Jetpack XR, new Compose APIs) are emerging. Your modular approach makes it easier to adopt or swap out modules without disturbing everything else.

In short: **Yes, this is effectively the “most advanced” or at least the *recommended modern* architecture for Android**—and definitely the one I’d use (and do use) for serious, production-ready apps.

## Share ViewModel 


## 1. Decide If the ViewModel Truly Is Shared

Ask yourself: **Is 90%+ of the logic identical for both phone and Wear?**
- If **yes**: moving that logic to a shared module is *ideal*. You only maintain one source of truth—less code duplication, fewer bugs.
- If **no** (i.e., the watch needs *really different* logic or states), you may keep them in separate modules and share only the domain/repository layer.

### Example: Shared Logic, Different UI
Often, the same HealthViewModel can handle the domain logic (e.g. retrieving health data, managing sessions, etc.), while each platform has its own Composables. If the watch UI is drastically simpler or handles different gestures, you can still have a single shared ViewModel for data flow and two different sets of composables hooking into it.

---

## 2. Approaches for Sharing ViewModels

### **Approach A**: Single “Core” ViewModel
1. Create a new module, e.g. `:core:health` or `:shared:health`, and move the `HealthViewModel` + `HealthEvent`, `HealthUiState` in there.
2. In the **phone** module (`:feature:health`), you `import com.yourpackage.core.health.HealthViewModel` and provide it via Hilt or your DI framework.
3. In the **watch** module (`:wearos:health`), you do the same.

Each platform’s composables (`HealthRoute` for phone vs. `HealthRouteWear` for watch) collect state from **the same** `HealthViewModel`. If needed, you can create separate sub-ViewModels if Wear has truly unique logic.

### **Approach B**: Shared “Domain” + Separate “UI” ViewModels
If phone and watch each need *slightly* different states or handle different events:

1. Put **domain logic** (repositories, use-cases, data classes) in `:core:health`.
2. Each platform has its own `HealthViewModel` that depends on the same domain code. Something like:
   - `PhoneHealthViewModel` → extends or composes `CommonHealthUseCase` from `:core:health`.
   - `WearHealthViewModel` → also uses `CommonHealthUseCase`.
3. This way, your domain logic is still shared, but each platform’s `ViewModel` can maintain platform-specific states, if necessary.

---

## 3. Typical Directory Layout

Let’s imagine you unify everything in a `:core:health` module. The layout might look like:

```
:core:health/
 ├─ src/
 │   └─ main/
 │       └─ java/
 │           └─ com.ylabz.basepro.core.health
 │               ├─ HealthViewModel.kt
 │               ├─ HealthUiState.kt
 │               ├─ HealthEvent.kt
 │               ├─ repository/
 │               └─ domain/
 └─ build.gradle.kts
```

Then, phone and watch modules only hold their **UI** code (e.g., `HealthRoute.kt`, `HealthComposable.kt`), which reference the shared `HealthViewModel` from `:core:health`.

---

## 4. Ensuring Hilt Works Across Modules

If you’re using Hilt:

1. In `:core:health`’s `build.gradle.kts`, apply the `kotlin("android")` plugin (and optionally Hilt’s Gradle plugin).
2. Mark `HealthViewModel` with `@HiltViewModel`.
3. Make sure your main (phone) and watch modules have the necessary Hilt setup so they can inject that shared ViewModel. For example, you might have an entry point or `@InstallIn` annotation referencing `SingletonComponent` or `ViewModelComponent`.

Because each app module (phone or watch) compiles in the `:core:health` code, the Hilt injection graph sees that `HealthViewModel` and can provide it to composables (via `hiltViewModel()`).

---

## 5. Key Considerations

1. **UI Differences**: If watch and phone have drastically different flows, you may want separate “UI only” modules or separate ViewModels with a shared domain.
2. **Lifecycle**: The watch might have certain restrictions or lifecycle differences (ambient mode, power constraints, etc.). If that logic is distinct, you can wrap it behind if-else or separate it entirely.
3. **Minimizing Duplication**: If the phone’s `HealthViewModel` is 80% the same as the watch’s, you can unify that logic in one place—just be mindful of any watch-specific or phone-specific code you might need to separate out.

---

## Bottom Line

- **Yes**, you can move both ViewModels (or just the shared domain logic) into a **core** or **shared** module so you don’t maintain two copies of basically the same code.
- **If** watch and phone differ significantly, you can still share the *domain* layer and keep separate platform-specific `HealthViewModel`s.
- The final arrangement depends on how similar the phone and watch logic are. If they’re nearly identical, a single “core” `HealthViewModel` used by both is the cleanest solution.
