To create a new project called `YouProject` based on your existing `BasePro` project, you can follow these steps. This process involves copying the project, renaming files and directories, and adjusting settings to reflect the new project name.

### Step 1: Copy the Project

1. **Copy the Entire Project Directory**:
    - Go to your file explorer and copy the entire `BasePro` project directory.
    - Paste it into the desired location and rename the copied directory to `YourProject`.

### Step 2: Rename the Project Internally

2. **Open the New Project in Android Studio**:
    - Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing project."
    - Navigate to the `YourProject` directory you just created and open it.

3. **Update the Project Name**:
    - In Android Studio, open `settings.gradle.kts` and change the root project name to `YourProject`:

      ```kotlin
      rootProject.name = "YourProject"
      ```

4. **Update Package Names**:
    - If you want to change the package name (e.g., from `com.ylabz.basepro` to `com.your.project`), you need to do the following:
        - In the `app/src/main/java/` directory, right-click the old package name and choose `Refactor > Rename`.
        - Enter the new package name (e.g., `com.your.project`).
        - Android Studio will prompt you to refactor the package name across all files. Accept this to update all references.

5. **Update Application ID**:
    - Open `app/build.gradle.kts` and change the `applicationId` to match the new package name:

      ```kotlin
      namespace = "com.your.project"
      defaultConfig {
          applicationId = "com.your.project"
          // other configurations
      }
      ```

### Step 3: Update Project-Specific Settings

6. **Update the Namespace in Each Module**:
    - For each module (e.g., `app`, `data`, `feature`), open their respective `build.gradle.kts` files and update the `namespace` to reflect the new package name. For example:

      ```kotlin
      android {
          namespace = "com.ylabz.basepro"
          // other configurations
      }
      ```

7. **Update Any Hardcoded Strings**:
    - Use the "Find and Replace" feature in Android Studio (`Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac or `Ctrl + Shift + R` on Windows) to search for the old project name (`BasePro`) and replace it with `BasePro`. This includes any hardcoded references in comments, logs, or other parts of the codebase.

### Step 4: Clean and Rebuild the Project

8. **Clean and Rebuild**:
    - After making all the necessary changes, clean and rebuild the project:
        - `Build > Clean Project`
        - `Build > Rebuild Project`
    - This step will ensure that all changes are properly applied and that there are no lingering references to the old project.

### Step 5: Version Control (Optional)

9. **Update Git Repository**:
    - If you are using Git for version control, you might want to remove the existing `.git` directory in the new `YourProject` project and initialize a new repository:
        - Delete the `.git` directory inside `YourProject`.
        - Run `git init` to start a new repository.
        - Add all files and commit the initial version of `YourProject`.

### Final Check

10. **Run the Project**:
    - Once everything is set up, try running the project to ensure that it has been properly renamed and is functioning as expected.

This process effectively duplicates your original project and renames it, allowing you to start a new project (`YourProject`) with the same foundation as `BasePro`.
