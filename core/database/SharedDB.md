It's not necessarily an all‑or‑nothing situation. While you may have to create separate database 
modules (with distinct `RoomDatabase` classes, entities, DAOs, etc.) for each app when their schemas 
differ significantly, there are ways you can still reuse code for common functionality. Here are some 
ideas on how to share code even when the databases are separate:

---

### 1. **Common Base Classes and Interfaces**

- **Base Repository or DAO Interfaces:**  
  If both databases perform similar operations (like CRUD operations), you can define common base 
- interfaces in a shared module. Each app-specific repository or DAO can extend or implement these interfaces.

- **Abstract Base Database Classes:**  
  If there's a lot in common regarding the way you configure or use Room (for example, helper 
- functions for migration or error handling), you can put those in an abstract base class in your 
- common module. Then, your concrete databases (e.g., `AshBikeDB` and `PhotoDB`) extend this base class.

---

### 2. **Shared Utility Functions**

- **Utility Classes:**  
  Many database operations involve similar tasks—logging, handling exceptions, converting entities, 
- or even network synchronization. These can be placed in a common library that both modules depend on.

- **Converters or Mappers:**  
  If there is any overlap in how you convert or map data between layers (for example, converting from 
- a network DTO to a database entity), you could share those conversion/mapping utilities.

---

### 3. **Modularized Common Libraries**

- **Common Data Module:**  
  Create a separate module (e.g., `:common-data`) that contains the shared business logic, base classes, 
- utilities, and possibly even abstract definitions of DAOs or repositories.
    - Each app module (e.g., `ashbike` and `photodo`) can then depend on this module.
    - They can provide their own implementations while reusing a lot of the shared logic.

---

### 4. **Shared Configuration and Setup Code**

- **Hilt Components or Modules:**  
  Even if you have separate Hilt modules for each database, you can extract shared binding logic into 
- a common Hilt module. For example, if there are common database configurations or migration strategies, 
- that code can live in a shared module and be used by the app-specific modules.

---

### Summary

- **Separate Schemas Necessitate Separate Database Implementations:**  
  Yes, if the schemas are really different, you’ll have separate Room setups (entities, DAOs, database classes) per module.

- **Code Reuse Is Still Possible:**  
  You can share common code, such as base interfaces, abstract classes, utility functions, mappers, 
- or even shared Hilt configurations, in a common module. This way, the app modules remain independent 
- in terms of their final database schema and DI setup, but you’re not entirely duplicating code.

- **Modularization:**  
  Consider creating a shared module (e.g., `:common`) for common business logic and utilities, 
- while letting your `ashbike` and `photodo` modules implement their specific database layers.

It might feel a bit more complex than simply having one shared database, but this approach keeps the 
apps truly independent and lets you maximize reuse for the portions of your code that are common to both.
