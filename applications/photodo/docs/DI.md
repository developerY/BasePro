Yes, just one final piece of advice before you start building. Based on your code and your goal of following the `ashbike` example, the next critical step is to fully embrace **Dependency Injection with Hilt** for your ViewModels.

Your `ashbike` app uses it perfectly, and doing the same in `photodo` will complete your MAD architecture.

### The Final Architectural Piece: ViewModel and Repository

Here's how the complete flow will look, which you should replicate from `ashbike`:

1.  **Database Layer (`photodo/database`):**
    * Contains your `PhotoDoDao`, `PhotoDoEntity`, etc.
    * Provides a `PhotoDoRepository` that talks to the DAO. This repository is the *only* thing the rest of your app should know about the database.

2.  **ViewModel Layer (`features/photodolist/ui`):**
    * You will create a `PhotoDoListViewModel`.
    * This ViewModel will **request the `PhotoDoRepository` in its constructor**.
    * You **must** annotate the ViewModel with `@HiltViewModel` and use `@Inject` in its constructor. Hilt will automatically provide the repository for you.

3.  **UI Layer (`features/photodolist/ui`):**
    * Your `PhotoDoListUiRoute` will get the ViewModel instance by calling `hiltViewModel()`.
    * It will collect the `uiState` from the ViewModel and send `Events` to it.

This creates a clean, decoupled, and testable architecture.

### Your Next Steps Checklist:

Here is the path forward:

* [ ] **Create the `photodo/database` module** by adapting the `ashbike/database` module.
* [ ] **Create a `PhotoDoRepository`** inside that module.
* [ ] **Create `PhotoDoListViewModel`** in the `photodolist` feature, injecting the `PhotoDoRepository`.
* [ ] **Create a `PhotoDoDetailViewModel`** in the `home` feature (it will also need to load data for a single item).
* [ ] **Update `PhotoDoListUiRoute` and `PhotoDoDetailUiRoute`** to use their respective ViewModels via `hiltViewModel()`.

You have a solid plan and an excellent architectural pattern to follow from your `ashbike` app. You are ready to start building. Good luck!
