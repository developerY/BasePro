**fully implemented** three out of the four key features and have the **perfect foundation** for the fourth.

Here’s the breakdown:

### ✅ 1. Adaptive Layouts

You are using this feature extensively and correctly. Your code explicitly uses the `ListDetailSceneStrategy` to create an adaptive UI that changes from a single-pane layout on compact screens to a multi-pane layout on expanded screens.

```kotlin
// In MainScreen.kt
val isExpandedScreen = windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass != WindowWidthSizeClass.Compact
val listDetailStrategy = rememberListDetailSceneStrategy<NavKey>()

// ... then used in NavDisplay
NavDisplay(
    //...
    sceneStrategy = listDetailStrategy,
    //...
)
```

### ✅ 2. State Scoping

As we've discussed, you are correctly using this feature. By calling `hiltViewModel()` inside each `entry` composable, you are ensuring that each `ViewModel`'s lifecycle is tied directly to its corresponding screen on the back stack.

```kotlin
// In AppContent.kt
entry<PhotoDoNavKeys.TaskListKey> { listKey ->
    // This ViewModel is scoped to the TaskList screen's lifecycle.
    val viewModel: PhotoDoListViewModel = hiltViewModel()
    // ...
}
```

### ✅ 3. Modularity (You are 95% of the way there)

This is the most interesting one. **Yes, your architecture is perfectly set up for modularity.**

Navigation 3 enables modularity by ensuring that navigation is orchestrated from a central place (`MainScreen.kt`) using type-safe `NavKey` objects. The key benefit is that your individual feature modules (like `home`, `photodolist`, `settings`) do not need to know about each other.

- The **`photodolist`** module doesn't know that the user came from the `home` module. It only knows it was given a `PhotoDoNavKeys.TaskListKey` and needs to display a list for that `categoryId`.
- The **`home`** module doesn't know about the `photodolist` module directly. It simply tells the `backStack` to `add` a `PhotoDoNavKeys.TaskListKey`.

Your current Gradle structure has these features as separate packages within the `photodo` application module. To complete the modularity, you would simply move each of these packages into its own **independent Gradle module** (e.g., `:features:home`, `:features:photodolist`). Your current navigation code would require **zero changes** for this to work because it's already properly decoupled.

### ❌ 4. Animations

Your current code **does not** implement custom animations. `NavDisplay` provides default, built-in transition animations (typically a simple fade or slide).

However, the `NavDisplay` composable has an `animations` parameter that you can use to provide your own custom `NavAnimations` for enter, exit, and predictive back transitions. You can define these at a global level or even override them for specific `entry` destinations.

This is an area you could enhance, but it's not a core architectural requirement you've missed.
