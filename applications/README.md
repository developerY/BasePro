Yes, you can absolutely split out your “features” and your “apps” into separate top-level directories in a multi-module Android project. The Gradle build system doesn’t care too much about *where* your modules live on disk—what matters is that you properly include each module in your **settings.gradle** file and set up dependencies correctly in each module’s Gradle file.

## Example directory structure

A common approach is something like this:

```
Root
 ├─ apps
 │   ├─ MyMainApp
 │   │   ├─ build.gradle.kts
 │   │   └─ ...
 │   ├─ MyOtherApp
 │   │   ├─ build.gradle.kts
 │   │   └─ ...
 │   └─ ...
 ├─ features
 │   ├─ feature_alarm
 │   ├─ feature_camera
 │   ├─ feature_home
 │   ├─ ...
 ├─ core
 │   ├─ data
 │   ├─ domain
 │   ├─ common_ui
 │   └─ ...
 ├─ settings.gradle.kts
 └─ build.gradle.kts
```

Inside **settings.gradle.kts**, you would include them like this:

```kotlin
rootProject.name = "BasePro"

include(":apps:MyMainApp")
include(":apps:MyOtherApp")

include(":features:feature_alarm")
include(":features:feature_camera")
include(":features:feature_home")
// etc.

include(":core:data")
include(":core:domain")
include(":core:common_ui")
// etc.
```

Then, within each module’s **build.gradle.kts**, you declare its dependencies. For example, if your `MyMainApp` depends on the `feature_home` and `feature_camera` modules, you’d have something like:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(project(":features:feature_home"))
    implementation(project(":features:feature_camera"))
    implementation(project(":core:data"))
    // etc.
}
```

## Considerations for Hilt and Compose Navigation

1. **Hilt DI**  
   Hilt doesn’t really care about your file structure; it only cares that each module is set up with Hilt’s Gradle plugin and that your Dagger/Hilt modules (e.g., `@Module`, `@InstallIn`) are discoverable at compile time.
    - If you have a shared “core” or “data” module that provides repositories or network dependencies, just make sure the `@InstallIn` scopes and the `kapt`/`annotationProcessor` dependencies are configured properly in each Gradle module where you need them.

2. **Compose Navigation**  
   With Compose Navigation, you can organize each “feature” module so it exports one or more `@Composable` destination(s).
    - If you’re doing multi-module navigation, you can keep a central `NavHost` in your “app” module and import the Composable screens from your feature modules.
    - Alternatively, each feature can define its own navigation graph extension, but you just need to ensure you have a consistent way of combining them in the “app” module’s NavHost.

3. **Gradle Settings**
    - As soon as you physically move a module into a new directory, you must update `include(":...")` paths in **settings.gradle**.
    - The name after the colon (`:`) in `include` is just the logical name of the module. The path in parentheses (like `(":features:feature_home")`) should match the directory structure you set up.

4. **Package Names**
    - The package name inside your source files (e.g., `com.example.feature.home`) does not have to match the folder structure in the project. You can keep them the same or rename them.
    - The important piece is that the `groupId` or `namespace` in the module’s **build.gradle** is set correctly for your code organization and publishing (if applicable).

5. **Refactoring**
    - If you have existing modules inside `feature/` that are actually entire “app” modules, you can move them into a new `apps/` folder. Then rename them in `settings.gradle` from `(":feature:myApp")` to `(":apps:myApp")`.
    - Once you do that, you’ll just update any project dependencies that referred to `(":feature:myApp")` to the new name.

## High-level steps to reorganize

1. **Create new directories**
    - Create `apps/` at the root level, next to `features/`, `core/`, etc.

2. **Move existing app modules**
    - Move any modules that are actual Android app “application” modules (i.e., have an `applicationId`, `com.android.application` plugin, etc.) into `apps/`.

3. **Update settings.gradle**
    - Remove old `include(":feature:someApp")` lines.
    - Add `include(":apps:someApp")` lines.

4. **Update module references**
    - In any `build.gradle.kts` that references those modules, change the dependency from `project(":feature:someApp")` to `project(":apps:someApp")`.

5. **Verify**
    - Sync Gradle and verify that all modules are recognized.
    - Confirm you can still run each app from Android Studio.

That’s it. The Android Gradle Plugin, Hilt, and Compose Navigation do not have any intrinsic limitations about how you structure your directories. As long as the modules are properly declared in **settings.gradle** and the dependencies are set up, you can freely organize your modules to keep your “features” separate from your “apps.”
