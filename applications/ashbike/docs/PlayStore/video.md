### **Key Narrative Beats (Why this works):**

1.  **The "Commuter" Hook:** It immediately targets daily riders who want utility, not just leisure.
2.  **The "Zero Footprint" Promise:** It emphasizes the unique privacy angle—that deleting a ride or the app truly leaves "no trace behind".
3.  **Visual Differentiation:** Instead of showing generic maps, it highlights the "Smart Trip Map" (grid, scale bar, compass) which is a unique visual feature of the app.
4.  **Battery/Data Efficiency:** It specifically mentions the "One-Shot Weather" and offline capabilities, addressing a major pain point for riders using their phones.
