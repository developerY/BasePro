Below is a **fully functional** example of a **Bike Home Screen** that uses:

- **Material 3** components (e.g., `Scaffold`, `NavigationBar`, `NavigationBarItem`,
  `CenterAlignedTopAppBar`).
- **Latest Jetpack Compose UI** patterns for a bottom navigation bar with **3 tabs**.

You can customize the icons, labels, and screen content to suit your app’s needs.

### Key Points

1. **CenterAlignedTopAppBar (M3)**
    - We’re using `CenterAlignedTopAppBar` from `androidx.compose.material3` for a modern look.

2. **NavigationBar (M3)**
    - Material 3’s replacement for the old BottomNavigation.
    - `NavigationBarItem` is used to create each tab.

3. **`selectedItem`**
    - A local state in `BikeHomeScreen` that tracks which tab is currently selected.
    - Clicking a tab updates this state, and the content is updated accordingly in the `Scaffold`’s
      content.

4. **Screen Content**
    - In a real app, each screen (Home, Routes, Settings) might be more elaborate or use the
      official Navigation Compose library for advanced navigation. This snippet simply demonstrates
      a straightforward, **single-activity** approach with a bottom nav.

This setup gives you a **scaffold** with a **Material 3** top bar and a **bottom navigation bar** of
three items.
You can extend or modify the screens as needed (e.g., adding your route planning UI, maps, or
settings).

Navigation::

If clicking still does nothing, the issue is likely more subtle or in a place we haven't explicitly
examined in this last pass
(e.g., an incorrect import that changes which BikeEvent is referenced, a DI issue with the
ViewModel, a problem with the NavController
instance, or an unexpected recomposition causing the LaunchedEffect for navigation collection to
cancel and restart).The most effective
way forward is still the logging I outlined previously. Please add the Log.d("YOUR_TAG", "Relevant
message") statements at these key points:

1.GpsLevelIndicator.kt: Inside the clickable lambda, before onEvent(...).
2.SpeedAndProgressCard.kt: Inside the lambda passed as onEvent to GpsLevelIndicator.
3.BikeDashboardContent.kt: Inside the lambda passed as onBikeEvent to SpeedAndProgressCard.
4.BikeUiRoute.kt: Inside the lambda passed as onEvent to BikeDashboardContent.
5.BikeViewModel.kt: At the start of onEvent(event: BikeEvent), inside the
RequestGpsSettingsNavigation case, and inside onNavigateToGpsSettingsRequested() before _
navigateTo.emit().
6.BikeUiRoute.kt: Inside the collectLatest block for viewModel.navigateTo.
7.bikeNavGraph.kt: Inside the composable block for the settings route, logging the received
cardToExpand argument.
8.SettingsUiRoute.kt: Logging the initialCardKeyToExpand it receives.
9.SettingsScreenExpand.kt: Inside the LaunchedEffect, logging initialCardKeyToExpand and whether the
condition to expand is met.

This structured logging will definitively show where the chain breaks. Without it, we are working
with the assumption that the code I "wrote"
is perfectly reflected and that all surrounding code is also perfect, which might not be the case.
