Below is some constructive feedback on your design. Overall, it looks user-friendly and functional—great work so far!

## 1. Layout & Hierarchy

- **Speedometer Front and Center:** Placing the large speedometer in the middle is intuitive and keeps the primary metric (current speed) in focus.
- **Wind & Weather at the Top Corners:** The small wind dial on the left and weather badge on the right are easy to spot without distracting from the speedometer.
- **Start/Pause & Stop Buttons on the Bottom Corners:** This placement feels natural for a bike app—clear, thumb-friendly targets for quick interactions.
- **Stat Tiles Below:** Displaying stats like Distance, Duration, Avg Speed, etc. in a row or grid under the main card neatly separates them from the primary ride controls.

### Potential Improvements
- **Spacing Consistency:** Ensure the spacing around each component (top elements, gauge, bottom controls, and stats) is visually balanced. Extra padding around the edges can help each element breathe.
- **Separation of Sections:** Consider adding subtle dividers or different background tones to visually separate the main card (speedometer/controls) from the lower stat tiles.

## 2. Color & Contrast

- **Blue Background:** The bold blue color for the main card is eye-catching, but ensure there’s enough contrast for text and icons (like the red needle).
- **Button Colors:** Your white floating action buttons (FABs) stand out clearly against the blue, which is good. If you have a brand accent color, you might unify the button colors or icons to reflect that.
- **Weather Badge:** The gray badge for “RAINY” might blend slightly with the background. Consider a different text color or a subtle background shape to make it more distinct.

## 3. Typography & Sizing

- **Speed Readout:** A large, clear numeric font for the “0 km/h” helps quick glances. You could emphasize it further by increasing its size or using a thicker weight.
- **Stat Tiles Below:** Keeping the text simple is good, but watch for consistent font sizes and alignment. For instance, “0.0 km” vs. “0m” have different lengths—ensuring alignment (left, center, or right) can help with readability.

## 4. Iconography & Visual Elements

- **Consistent Icon Style:**
    - The wind dial icon, weather condition icon, bike icon, and the FAB icons (play/pause/stop) each serve different purposes. Aim for a unified style (line thickness, fill, color palette).
    - The bike icon is a fun touch near the progress bar; it visually connects the user’s journey to the UI.
- **Speedometer Needle & Markers:** The red needle and numeric labels are clear. You might consider adding minor tick marks for a more realistic gauge look, but that’s a matter of preference.

## 5. Interactions & User Flow

- **Start/Pause/Stop Buttons:** Placing them at the bottom corners with large touch targets is good for a biking scenario where the user may tap quickly (even while moving).
- **Future Enhancements:**
    - Consider subtle feedback (e.g., a slight color change or ripple animation) when tapping start/pause/stop.
    - Use animations when transitioning from paused to active states (e.g., animate the speedometer needle if you want a more polished experience).

### Overall Assessment

Your design is clear, functional, and visually easy to understand at a glance—which is crucial for a biking app. The large speedometer, prominent control buttons, and modular stats below are user-friendly. Small refinements in color harmony, spacing, and typography can elevate it further.

**Great job so far, and keep iterating!**
