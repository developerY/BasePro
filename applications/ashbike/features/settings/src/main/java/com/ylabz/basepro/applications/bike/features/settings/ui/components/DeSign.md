Below is a simple visual concept (first in a quick diagram, then in a Jetpack Compose snippet) to
illustrate having **one “Settings” tab** with **two sub-sections**—one for “App Preferences” and one
for “Bike Configuration.”

## Visual Diagram

Imagine tapping the “Settings” icon in the bottom navigation bar. You then see a screen like this:

```
┌───────────────────────────┐
│         Settings          │  <- TopAppBar
├───────────────────────────┤
│   App Preferences    >    │  <- Clickable list item
├───────────────────────────┤
│   Bike Configuration >    │  <- Clickable list item
└───────────────────────────┘
```

- **App Preferences** might include things like units (miles vs. km), language, notifications,
  theme, etc.
- **Bike Configuration** might include motor assistance levels, gearing settings, brake calibration,
  firmware updates, etc.

When the user taps **App Preferences**, it navigates to a new screen showing all the app-level
settings.  
When the user taps **Bike Configuration**, it navigates to a new screen with the bike-related
settings.

## Jetpack Compose Example

Here’s a minimal Compose sample demonstrating how you could structure it. You’d show
`SettingsScreen()` when the user selects the Settings tab. Then, each sub-item navigates to a
separate screen (`AppPreferencesScreen()` or `BikeConfigurationScreen()`).

### How It All Fits Together

1. **Settings Tab in Bottom Navigation**: When the user taps the Settings icon, show
   `SettingsScreen()`.
2. **SettingsScreen**: Displays two clickable items:
    - **App Preferences** → navigates to `AppPreferencesScreen()`
    - **Bike Configuration** → navigates to `BikeConfigurationScreen()`
3. **Sub-Screens**: Each screen (app-level vs. bike-level) has its own layout and controls.

With this approach, you keep the bottom navigation **simple** (only one Settings icon), but once
inside, you separate **App** vs. **Bike** settings clearly.

Many apps use **similar patterns** for complex settings, but there isn’t a single “right” way—it
depends on how many settings you have and how often users need to change them. Here are some *
*common approaches**:

1. **Preference Screens (Classic Android Style)**
    - Historically, Android offered “PreferenceActivity” and “PreferenceFragment” to show a
      structured list of preferences (toggles, lists, etc.). Many apps still use these or Compose
      equivalents (`rememberPreferenceState`, etc.).
    - **Pros**: Familiar to Android users, easy to group related settings.
    - **Cons**: Can become lengthy if you have many advanced settings, and the old preference APIs
      are less customizable in terms of UI/UX.

2. **Separate Screens for Each Category**
    - Apps with **a lot** of advanced or technical settings often break them into multiple screens (
      e.g., “General Settings,” “Notifications,” “Advanced,” etc.). Each screen has its own toggles
      and controls.
    - **Pros**: Keeps each screen focused, avoids overwhelming the user with too many options at
      once.
    - **Cons**: Requires more navigation steps if users want to change multiple settings at once.

3. **Tabbed Interface**
    - Some apps use a single “Settings” activity with **tabs** for each major category (e.g.,
      “Account,” “Notifications,” “Privacy”).
    - **Pros**: Quick switching between categories, visually organized.
    - **Cons**: If each tab is large, it can be cumbersome to find specific settings.

4. **Expandable Sections (Collapsible Cards)**
    - The approach you’re using—grouping settings into collapsible sections—is also **quite common**
      for more custom or visually rich settings screens.
    - **Pros**: Everything is in one place, but hidden behind collapsible sections so users aren’t
      overwhelmed.
    - **Cons**: If you have many categories or deeply nested settings, it can get large quickly.
      Also, if a user needs to configure multiple expanded sections, they might do a lot of
      scrolling.

5. **Hybrid Approaches**
    - Some apps combine these ideas: they might have a **top-level** settings screen with just a few
      categories (like “General,” “Advanced,” “About”), and then each category might be an *
      *expandable** section or a **separate** screen with tabs or collapsible cards.
    - **Pros**: Very flexible, can scale with complexity.
    - **Cons**: You have to carefully design navigation so it doesn’t feel disjointed.

### Which One is “Most Common”?

- **Simple or Medium-Complex Apps**: Often use a **single settings screen** with either a **list** (
  classic preference style) or **collapsible cards** (like your approach).
- **Very Large / Enterprise Apps**: Often break settings into **multiple screens** or sub-flows.
- **Highly Custom Apps**: Use **fully custom** Compose layouts with a mix of collapsible sections,
  toggles, and multi-step wizards for advanced settings.

In other words, **there’s no single universal pattern**—it depends on how many settings you have,
how advanced they are, and what your users expect. Your **collapsible card** approach is a **valid,
modern**, and fairly **common** way to keep a large settings screen tidy and user-friendly.

If it were up to me, I’d lean toward a **hybrid approach** that combines the best of both worlds:

1. **Overview Screen with Expandable Sections:**  
   – Use a single, scrollable settings screen (via a LazyColumn) that groups settings into
   expandable cards.  
   – Each card shows the “80%” of settings most users need right away. For example, the Bike
   Configuration card would let users quickly adjust motor assistance, gearing, etc., without
   overwhelming them.

2. **Access to Advanced Options:**  
   – Inside each expandable section, include a clear button (like “Advanced Options” or “More
   Settings”) that navigates to a dedicated, deeper settings screen.  
   – This keeps the main screen uncluttered while still catering to power users who need more
   granular control.

3. **Consistent Visual Hierarchy & Profile Overview:**  
   – Start with a top-level overview card (showing user info or bike status) to set context.  
   – Use uniform styling (cards, icons, dividers) to make each section feel part of a cohesive
   whole.

4. **Navigation & Responsiveness:**  
   – For the advanced screens, I’d use Compose Navigation (or a state-based approach) to keep
   navigation smooth and encapsulated.  
   – Ensure the user can easily return to the main settings screen without losing context.

This approach gives users a clear, uncluttered view of the most common settings while still
providing the flexibility for more detailed adjustments. It’s a pattern used in many modern apps
because it balances simplicity with depth, and it adapts well if your settings grow over time.
