Not quite—`SyncRideUseCase` belongs in the *feature/domain* layer (your Bike module), 
because it needs to know about your `BikeRide` model. The HealthConnect module should only expose the 
plumbing (the `HealthConnectRepository` interface, the `HealthSessionManager` infra, and the `HealthViewModel` 
that knows how to call that infra).

So your structure ends up like this:

```
bike-feature/            // knows about BikeRideEntity
 ├─ SyncRideUseCase      // maps BikeRide → List<Record>, injects HealthConnectRepository
 └─ TripsViewModel       // calls SyncRideUseCase

healthconnect-api/       // only depends on health-connect SDK
 └─ interface HealthConnectRepository

healthconnect-impl/      // implements healthconnect-api
 ├─ HealthConnectRepositoryImpl
 ├─ HealthSessionManager
 └─ HealthViewModel      // injects HealthConnectRepository, handles permissions + events
```

* **`SyncRideUseCase` stays in your Bike module**, because it builds records from your domain entity.
* **HealthConnect module** only provides the interface and its implementation plus a ViewModel that can be driven by events.

This keeps each module focused on its own concerns and avoids entangling your Health infra with domain models.
