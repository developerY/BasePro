Below is a simple visual concept (first in a quick diagram, then in a Jetpack Compose snippet) to illustrate having **one “Settings” tab** with **two sub-sections**—one for “App Preferences” and one for “Bike Configuration.”

## Visual Diagram

Imagine tapping the “Settings” icon in the bottom navigation bar. You then see a screen like this:

```
┌───────────────────────────┐
│         Settings          │  <- TopAppBar
├───────────────────────────┤
│   App Preferences    >    │  <- Clickable list item
├───────────────────────────┤
│   Bike Configuration >    │  <- Clickable list item
└───────────────────────────┘
```

- **App Preferences** might include things like units (miles vs. km), language, notifications, theme, etc.
- **Bike Configuration** might include motor assistance levels, gearing settings, brake calibration, firmware updates, etc.

When the user taps **App Preferences**, it navigates to a new screen showing all the app-level settings.  
When the user taps **Bike Configuration**, it navigates to a new screen with the bike-related settings.

## Jetpack Compose Example

Here’s a minimal Compose sample demonstrating how you could structure it. You’d show `SettingsScreen()` when the user selects the Settings tab. Then, each sub-item navigates to a separate screen (`AppPreferencesScreen()` or `BikeConfigurationScreen()`).

### How It All Fits Together

1. **Settings Tab in Bottom Navigation**: When the user taps the Settings icon, show `SettingsScreen()`.
2. **SettingsScreen**: Displays two clickable items:
    - **App Preferences** → navigates to `AppPreferencesScreen()`
    - **Bike Configuration** → navigates to `BikeConfigurationScreen()`
3. **Sub-Screens**: Each screen (app-level vs. bike-level) has its own layout and controls.

With this approach, you keep the bottom navigation **simple** (only one Settings icon), but once inside, you separate **App** vs. **Bike** settings clearly.
