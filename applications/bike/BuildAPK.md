Awesome setup â€” youâ€™re using a clean MAD multi-module structure and you've scoped your applications nicely under `applications`, while features live in `feature`. You're also set up with `libs.versions.toml`, which is great.

To help you generate a standalone **APK for the `bike` app**, here's what Iâ€™ll need (and what needs to be done):

---

### âœ… **What I Need From You**
1. **TOML File**  
   This helps verify the correct versions of Compose, Kotlin, AGP, and plugins like Hilt. Please upload it.

2. **Main Launcher Entry Point**
    - Which Composable is your `MainActivity` or `NavHost` for the `bike` app?
    - Is there a specific `Activity` in `:applications:bike` you want to launch?

3. **App Icon**  
   You've mentioned Play Store and icons â€” please confirm:
    - Do you have an adaptive icon XML and foreground image (`ic_launcher_foreground.png`)?
    - Or just a single PNG youâ€™d like us to turn into an icon?

4. **Whether to Strip Other Modules**
    - Should the final APK **only include the `bike` app** (i.e., remove `home`, `medtime`, `photodo`)?
    - Or should we still build it as part of the big umbrella app (just show bike on startup)?

---

### âœ… **What Iâ€™ll Provide**
Once I have that, Iâ€™ll help you:
- âœ… Configure a **`bikeApp` build variant** or **separate app module** (if you want a minimal APK).
- âœ… Make sure `applicationId` and `icon` are bike-specific.
- âœ… Set the correct launcher `Activity` or Composable.
- âœ… Show you how to generate the APK via Gradle or Android Studio.

Letâ€™s start by:
ðŸ‘‰ Uploading your `libs.versions.toml` file  
ðŸ‘‰ Confirming your bike module entry point  
ðŸ‘‰ Sharing your app icon (or I can make one from a PNG you upload)

Then Iâ€™ll guide you step-by-step.
