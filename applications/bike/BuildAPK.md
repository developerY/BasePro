Awesome setup — you’re using a clean MAD multi-module structure and you've scoped your applications nicely under `applications`, while features live in `feature`. You're also set up with `libs.versions.toml`, which is great.

To help you generate a standalone **APK for the `bike` app**, here's what I’ll need (and what needs to be done):

---

### ✅ **What I Need From You**
1. **TOML File**  
   This helps verify the correct versions of Compose, Kotlin, AGP, and plugins like Hilt. Please upload it.

2. **Main Launcher Entry Point**
    - Which Composable is your `MainActivity` or `NavHost` for the `bike` app?
    - Is there a specific `Activity` in `:applications:bike` you want to launch?

3. **App Icon**  
   You've mentioned Play Store and icons — please confirm:
    - Do you have an adaptive icon XML and foreground image (`ic_launcher_foreground.png`)?
    - Or just a single PNG you’d like us to turn into an icon?

4. **Whether to Strip Other Modules**
    - Should the final APK **only include the `bike` app** (i.e., remove `home`, `medtime`, `photodo`)?
    - Or should we still build it as part of the big umbrella app (just show bike on startup)?

---

### ✅ **What I’ll Provide**
Once I have that, I’ll help you:
- ✅ Configure a **`bikeApp` build variant** or **separate app module** (if you want a minimal APK).
- ✅ Make sure `applicationId` and `icon` are bike-specific.
- ✅ Set the correct launcher `Activity` or Composable.
- ✅ Show you how to generate the APK via Gradle or Android Studio.

---

Let’s start by:
👉 Uploading your `libs.versions.toml` file  
👉 Confirming your bike module entry point  
👉 Sharing your app icon (or I can make one from a PNG you upload)

Then I’ll guide you step-by-step.

Great question — and yes, let’s take a step back and talk **big picture**.

---

## 🧠 What You're Doing: Multi-Module, Multi-App Architecture

You’ve set up a **Multi-Module Android MAD project** where:

- `feature/*`: Contains **shared, reusable functionality** (e.g., BLE, NFC, Weather, ML).
- `core/*`: Contains **shared architecture & models** (e.g., `data`, `model`, `ui`, `util`).
- `applications/*`: Each directory like `bike`, `home`, `medtime`, `photodo` is a **separate app UI** built on top of the shared `feature` and `core`.

### 🧩 The app module is your "host" — your Play Store target APK comes from here.

So now the question is:  
**"How do we switch which app gets launched in the final APK?"**

---

## 🧭 Option 1: Keep it simple — One APK per branch / config
This is what you're doing **right now**:
- Modify the `app` module’s `dependencies` to **only include the app you want** (e.g., `:applications:bike`).
- Set the **`MainActivity` and `RootNavGraph`** to start the right app screen (`BikeUiRoute`).
- Change app name + icon manually for each app build.

👉 You end up with **one app per build**, but it’s clean, simple, and works well for Play Store upload.

---

## 🚦 Option 2: Use Product Flavors for Each App

You can define **one flavor per app**, like this:

```kotlin
android {
    ...
    flavorDimensions += "app"
    productFlavors {
        create("bike") {
            dimension = "app"
            applicationId = "com.ylabz.bike"
            versionName = "1.0-bike"
        }
        create("home") {
            dimension = "app"
            applicationId = "com.ylabz.home"
            versionName = "1.0-home"
        }
        // etc.
    }
}
```

Then, inside each flavor block, you:
- Swap out the icon and app name
- Set a different entry point (or share one and route based on flavor)
- Only include the feature + app module you need

📦 This lets you build:
```bash
./gradlew assembleBikeRelease
./gradlew assembleHomeRelease
```

🧩 But it requires **more config and isolation** (like using `src/bike/...`, `src/home/...`, etc. if needed).

---

## ✅ Your Current Setup = Option 1

Right now, you are building the **Bike App APK** by:
- Including only `applications:bike` + needed features
- Pointing the `RootNavGraph` to `BikeUiRoute` → `MainScreen()` → `BikeDashboardContent()`
- Using a custom bike icon
- Excluding other apps like `home`, `medtime`, and `photodo`

✅ This works great for teams and faster iteration without the overhead of maintaining flavors.

## 💬 TL;DR
| Option | Description | Recommended for You? |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Manual Switch (Current)** | Only include the app you want to build in `dependencies` and `RootNavGraph` | ✅ Yes, simple and effective |
| **Product Flavors** | Create variants like `bike`, `home`, etc. in Gradle, and isolate resources/code per flavor | ❌ More config, only useful if you want to ship all from one repo without switching manually |

Let me know if you want to convert to product flavors or stick with your current setup — both are valid, but you’re doing great with the leaner approach.
