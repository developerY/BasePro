UX Flow - Step 1: Logging a Symptom

1. The Entry Point: Add a "Log" Button
   We will add a simple, intuitive + (Add) button to the "Symptom Tracker" card. This immediately
   signals to the user that this card is not just for viewing, but also for adding new information.

Before:

After (Proposed Change):

2. The Action: Launching the "Log Symptom" Dialog
   When the user taps the new + button, a dialog appears, asking for the basic details of the
   symptom.

3. The Core Question: Linking to Medications
   After the user fills in the symptom details and taps "Next," we present the most important new
   step: the linking screen.

* Logic: The app automatically looks at the user's medication log and finds all medications that
  were
  marked as "Taken" within a recent, relevant timeframe (e.g., the last 12 hours).

* UI: It presents this list to the user, asking them to identify a potential cause.

By tapping "Save," the user creates a direct link between the symptom they just felt and the
medication(s) they suspect might have caused it.

This workflow is the first crucial half of our bidirectional system. It's intuitive, builds directly
on the UI we've already created, and starts capturing incredibly valuable data from the very first
step.

UX Flow - Step 2: Tracking Effectiveness

1. The Entry Point: An Actionable "Take" Button
   For medications that are taken "as needed" (PRN), a simple checkbox isn't enough. We'll replace
   it
   with a clear "Take" button. This makes the action more intentional. For regularly scheduled meds,
   the checkbox can remain, but this new button is perfect for unscheduled doses.

Current UI (for a scheduled med):

Proposed UI (for an "as-needed" med):

2. The Core Question: "Why are you taking this?"
   When the user taps the "Take" button, we ask for the context. This is the most critical step for
   tracking effectiveness. A simple dialog appears.


3. The Action: Linking the Medication to the Symptom
   If the user selects "For a Symptom," we present a screen that lets them quickly choose which
   symptom they are treating.

Logic: The app shows a list of their most commonly logged symptoms for quick selection. It also
allows them to log a new one on the fly.

UI: A clean list of symptoms to link to the medication dose.

By tapping "Log Dose," the user creates a powerful link: this specific dose of Ibuprofen was taken
to treat a headache. Over time, this data will allow the app to show how effective Ibuprofen is at
relieving their headaches.

With both of these flows mapped out, we have a complete, bidirectional system for understanding the
relationship between medications and symptoms.
